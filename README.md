# Magician's Notepad üéØ


## Basic Details



### Team Members
- Meenakshi S - LBSITW,TVM
### Project Description
A notepad in which thw words dissapear into the void along with a fake save button and some music.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We type too much. The world is too permanent. Where's the mystery?
Who needs digital permanence anyway?

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Words slowly vanish into the ether like a magician‚Äôs final act.

A floating hat whispers quotes to remind you this is all nonsense.
